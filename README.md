# Automated PDF Bookmarking Tool 🔖

This is a tool to automatically generate bookmarks for PDF files given a formatted list of bookmarks in plain text.

## Intended Usage ✍️

Designed to add bookmarks given a nested lit of bookmarks in the following format:

```text
Chapter 1
    Section 1.1
    Section 1.2
Chapter 2
    Section 2.1
        Subsection 2.1.1
